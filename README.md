[🔗 Visit the live site](https://numan-patil.github.io/)  

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website!  
This isn't just a static page; it's a dynamic and interactive digital playground designed to showcase my skills, projects, and personality.

The project is built with **pure HTML, CSS (powered by Tailwind CSS), and vanilla JavaScript**, focusing on creating a fun, engaging, and memorable user experience through clean code and playful animations.
